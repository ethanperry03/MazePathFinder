A-Maze-ing Race | Project 2:
A maze solving program that uses both Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms to navigate through mazes.

Description:
This program reads maze maps from files, allows users to choose between BFS and DFS search algorithms, and outputs the solution path both to the console and to a file. The project demonstrates the implementation of graph traversal algorithms in a practical application.

Files and Directories:
main.cpp: Entry point of the program with user interface
maze.h/cpp: Maze class definition and implementation for maze representation and solving
position.h/cpp: Position class for tracking coordinates within the maze
mazeUtils.h/cpp: Utility functions for maze operations like loading and rendering
maps: Directory containing sample maze files and their solutions

Getting Started:

Dependencies:
C++11 or higher
G++ compiler or equivalent

Compile the program using g++:
g++ -o maze_solver main.cpp maze.cpp position.cpp mazeUtils.cpp -std=c++11

Run the compiled executable:
./maze_solver

Follow the prompts to:

- Enter a maze file path (e.g., maps/maze1.map)
- Choose a search algorithm (BFS or DFS)
- Specify an output file name for the solution

Example session:
---------- Welcome to The A-Maze-ing Race! ----------

Write path to your maze file: maps/maze1.map

---

Loading maps/maze1.map...

---

Choose a search algorithm:
Breadth First Search ---- (BFS)
Depth First Search ------ (DFS)

> BFS

---

What is the name of the output file? solution.txt

---

Input map:
[Maze is displayed here]

---

Breadth First Searching...
[Solution is displayed here]

---

Path Length: 15

# of Nodes Visited: 24

## Written to solution.txt

Maze files should follow this format:
First line: Width and height of the maze separated by a space
Subsequent lines: The maze itself, where:
'#' represents walls
'.' represents open paths
The top-left corner (0,0) is the start
The bottom-right corner is the goal
Example:
5 5

#####

#...#
#.#.#
#...#

#####

Algorithm Comparison
BFS (Breadth-First Search): Guarantees the shortest path but may explore more nodes
DFS (Depth-First Search): More memory efficient but doesn't guarantee the shortest path
